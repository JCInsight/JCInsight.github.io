Before the rise of pop and hiphop, there was a <em>classic</em> rock and roll. This is not the rock and roll that
is very well known today; this is the fast-paced version that drew inspiration from <strong>all genres of music.</strong>
Paul Anka was a music artist of this genre, and I was an avid follower of his music. Just remembering how the music used to make me &#40and others&#41 feel, especially
when it took all the great parts of many other genres and blended them into its own original type of music.</p>
