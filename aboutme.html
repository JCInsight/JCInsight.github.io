    <div class="DOCtitle">ABOUT ME</div>
    <div class="DOCmainBody"><p>Hello! I am a high school student in Toronto, Ontario with aspirations for the future!
        I aim to be a software engineer, since software is just about the only topic I would
        even imagine myself working on the future. 
        <br> <br>
        I want to work to become the best person I can be. Its not too much of a 
        far-fetched goal, right? Just form some good, healthy habits and stick with them - incoorperate
        them into your identity, work towards them, and be happy with what you've achieved. Easier said than done, haha!
        <br> <br>
        So far, I've been working out, studying &#40school&#41, reading up on computers and online resources, and 
        attending football practices. Funny how one's worth is determined by their youth!
